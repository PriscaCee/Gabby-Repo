# PriscaHomes – My Real Estate Website.

*Live on AWS S3 (HTTPS) →* https://priscahomes-2025.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/index.html  
*GitHub Pages version →* https://priscacee.github.io/Gabby-Repo/

A fully responsive real estate landing page I designed myself and directed Grok (xAI) to build it according to my exact specifications.

### What I Did.
- l decided on the brand name *PriscaHomes* and requested a custom “PH” house logo. 
- l chose Enugu locations (Independence Layout, Centenary City, New GRA) and Naira pricing.  
- Then gave a Grok clear instructions for layout, colors, text, and features.
- l personally handled all the Git commands, committed my file and pushed it.
- l created and configured the S3 bucket, enabled the static website hosting, set permissions, and deployed my website on it. 
- l managed the entire project workflow from idea to live deployment.

### Features (exactly as I specified).
- A custom house logo coined from the initials of PriscaHomes (P & H shaped like a house).
- A Hero section with strong *CTA (Call to Action)* – “Explore Properties →”
- l featured luxury properties in Enugu with their prices in Naira. 
- A fully mobile-responsive design.  
- And aclean navigation and personal footer.

### Tech Stack.
- HTML5 + CSS3 (code generated by Grok based on my instructions)  
- Git, GitHub & VSCode for version control (all commands executed by me)  
- An AWS S3 static website hosting (fully configured by me).

### A little back story about this project.
I’m currently learning AWS Cloud on my journey to becoming an *AWS Certified Solutions Architect*.  
Web design isn’t my background, so to complete the static-website deployment assignment I decided to partner with *Grok (xAI)*. I gave Grok clear instructions on branding (PriscaHomes), the custom PH house logo, Enugu locations, Naira pricing, and overall look. Grok generated the HTML/CSS code based on my directions, while I personally handled every step of Git/version control, S3 bucket creation, permissions, static website hosting configuration, and final deployment.  
This way I could focus on mastering the AWS concepts that matter for the certification while still delivering a beautiful, fully functional site.
